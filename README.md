# dotfiles

Hey John! What settings do you use for **\_\_\_\_\_**?

Here are most of the configuration files I use for my dev environment, editor, apps, linting, debugging, etc.

Also included are scripts I use for bootstrapping my environment, currently Windows 11's WSL2. (üî• highly recommended)

## Installation

Ignore the steps below and just go to this site to see how I'm manually doing it right now:

[Use git and GitHub to Manage Your dotfiles](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/)

Open a terminal and follow along!

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/johnmilazzo/dotfiles
2. CD into the folder: cd dotfiles
3. Execute the bootstrap script: sh ./install.sh
4. Restart the terminal or run source ~/.zshrc

# dotfiles

Hey John! What settings do you use for **\_\_\_\_\_**?

Here are most of the configuration files I use for my dev environment, editor, apps, linting, debugging, etc.

Also included are scripts I use for bootstrapping my environment, currently Windows 10's WSL2. (🔥 highly recommended)

## Installation

Open a terminal and follow along!

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/johnmilazzo/dotfiles
2. CD into the folder: cd dotfiles
3. Execute the bootstrap script: sh ./bootstrap.sh
4. Restart the terminal or run source ~/.zshrc

👍
